              # ENGAGEMENT WITH THE CLIENT
    
The client dejENDS will be working for is Mrs. Salamatu, owner of the business Special Brukina located in Ghana. dejENDS offered its services 
to many potential clients, but after discussing and hearing from Mrs. Salamatu, we have been able to reach an agreement on putting our skills 
together to satisfy her. She intends to level up her business communication by modernizing mainly how her customers can reach the company and 
make orders. After discussing with her, the ideal way for that will be to create a website that is easy for clients to use and that will 
benefit her and her business. The website will be made according to her preferences and her need for the best possible satisfaction and 
patronage. The idea is to create something based on her needs that will help to improve the relationship between Special Burkina and its 
customers. Some considerations are to be made for the rest of the project, but these are mainly the terms of our first agreement with the client.

               # SYSTEM'S FUNCTIONALITIES

• A page where customers/users can sign up
• Users should be able to log in after they sign up
• After the user has logged in, he or she should be able to file a 
complaint about the product on the page
• The user should also have the space to make a request for some of 
the product on the page
• Complaints and requests made by the user should be sent to the 
Manager’s email
• The user must receive feedback after making a request or filing a 
complaint
• The user should be able to log out after using the website

                # ARCHITECTURAL AND LOGICAL COMPONENTS OF THE WEBSITE
                
• User Interface (UI): The UI focuses on what the user sees when he or she visiats the website. HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT will 
be the technologies used to generate the UI of this website

• Frontend components: The user interacts with the frontend by making a request or signing into the website

• Backend API: An application layer is used to construct the website. The API components will help the user make requests
from the frontend to the backend using Application Programming Interface. API like JS, and Graph QL are used

• Server-side component: The component handles the email services, user requests, and authentification. Node Js is one 
popular library kit that will be used to handle the server-side architecture

• Database: User’s data are important for authentification hence a database will be needed. This is where the user’s information will 
be stored.

• Email services: This component is key for sending complaints or making requests as it is the user’s email that will be needed to 
access the server-side component

• Authentification and authorization: This component will be essential to guarantee that all the user’s details are secured and 
handled the right way. It includes services like registration, login or authorization to access particular features of the website

• Error handling: This helps handle errors by capturing all errors that happened to facilitate debugging or troubleshooting
processes

                # METHODOLOGY USED: AGILE 
                
The use of agile methodology to develop and design the website is due to the fact that using the agile model helps increase productivity and 
efficiency by constantly keeping in touch with the clients and frequentlyaccessing their reviews. This process will maximize the level of 
satisfaction of the client, and ensure more chances to fulfill the requirements and deadlines within the time initially decided.
